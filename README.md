[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vs-test-runner.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/vs-test-runner)

`vs-test-runner` is a tool to discover and run vstests (`vstest.console`) via [OpenCover](https://github.com/opencover/opencover) to generate code coverage reports. [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) is used to build an html report from the `coverage.xml` file generated by OpenCover.

## Installation

`npm install -g vs-test-runner`

## Usage

`vs-test-runner [--x64] [--release] [--coverage]`: Run all tests under the current working directory. If the `--coverage` flag is given, `OpenCover` will be used with `vstest.console` as the test container; otherwise, `vstest.console` will be used alone. To discover tests in "bin\Release" folders instead of "bin\Debug" folders, pass the `--release` flag. To run tests built for x64, pass to `--x64` flag.

## Report Code Coverage

```bat
npm install -g codecov
codecov -f coverage/coverage.xml --disable=gcov
```
